Jonathan-Cohen-Code-Sample
=====================

C++ code sample.

This C++ project is an implementation of Prim's Algorithm using an adjacency list and priority queue.  It was originally intended as a response to [this programming challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/20cydp/14042014_challenge_152_hard_minimum_spanning_tree/) on the dailyprogrammer subreddit, but I decided to clean it up for use here, sticking more or less to the Google C++ coding standards.  The code was not submitted for the challenge so there is no confusion about whether or not the code is actually mine.  It has been tested to compile cleanly with the command g++ *.cpp --std=c++11 -stdlib=libc++ -Wall on Mac OS X Mountain Lion using gcc 4.7 and without the stdlib tag using gcc 4.8. The file "challenge.txt" contains the challenge input form the original problem post linked above, and passing its filename to the program should produce the correct result.
